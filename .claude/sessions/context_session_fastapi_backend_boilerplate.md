# FastAPI Backend Boilerplate - Context Session

## Feature Description
Create a simple FastAPI backend boilerplate with health and ping routes.

## Initial Analysis

### Objective
Set up a minimal FastAPI application in the `backend/` directory with:
- Basic project structure
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Ping endpoint (`/ping`)
- Proper dependency management (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
- Basic configuration setup

### Technical Considerations

1. **Project Structure**
   - Main application file
   - Configuration module
   - Router organization
   - Dependency injection setup

2. **Endpoints Required**
   - `/health`: Returns application health status
   - `/ping`: Simple ping-pong response for connectivity testing

3. **Best Practices to Follow**
   - Hexagonal architecture patterns (as per project conventions)
   - Proper dependency management
   - Environment configuration
   - Type safety with Pydantic models

4. **Dependencies Needed**
   - FastAPI
   - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
   - Pydantic (data validation)
   - Python-dotenv (environment variables)

### Questions for Backend Developer Agent
1. Should we follow hexagonal architecture for this simple boilerplate?
2. What project structure would be most appropriate?
3. Should we include additional configuration for CORS, middleware, etc.?
4. What response models should we use for health and ping endpoints?

#### Key Recommendations

**Architecture Decision:**
- Use SIMPLIFIED hexagonal architecture (not full hexagonal for simple endpoints)
- Establish core patterns (domain, application, infrastructure layers)
- Avoid over-engineering while maintaining expansion path
- Balance between learning opportunities and pragmatism

**Project Structure:**
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── domain/              # Domain models (framework-agnostic)
│   ├── application/         # Application services (use cases)
│   └── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure adapters
│       ├── web/            # FastAPI routers, DTOs
│       └── middleware/     # Exception handlers
└── tests/                  # Comprehensive test suite
```

**Technology Stack:**
- FastAPI 0.115.0
- Uvicorn with standard extras (uvloop, httptools)
- Pydantic 2.9.2 + pydantic-settings 2.6.1
- pytest with async support

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
1. Domain models as frozen dataclasses with `__post_init__` validation
2. Application services with constructor dependency injection
3. Pydantic DTOs separate from domain models
4. Thin routers delegating to services via `Depends()`
5. Consistent error handling with custom exception handlers
6. Configuration via pydantic-settings with `@lru_cache()`

**Implementation Notes:**
- Python 3.11+ required (modern type hints)
- All handlers should be async
- CORS preconfigured for common dev ports
- OpenAPI documentation auto-generated
- 100% test coverage achievable for this simple boilerplate

**Documentation Created:**
Comprehensive implementation plan saved to:
`.claude/doc/fastapi_backend_boilerplate/backend.md`

Includes:
- Complete file-by-file implementation guide
- All code examples with detailed comments
- Critical implementation notes
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Testing strategy
- Production considerations
- Expansion patterns for future features

### Test Strategy Overview

A comprehensive test plan has been created covering all architectural layers with 105 test cases organized into unit tests, integration tests, and API tests. The strategy follows the testing pyramid principle with emphasis on unit testing and achieves 95%+ code coverage.

**Test Organization:**
```
backend/tests/
├── conftest.py                     # Shared fixtures (settings, app, client, time mocks)
├── unit/
│   ├── test_domain_models.py       # 23 tests (HealthStatus, HealthCheck, PingResponse)
│   ├── test_services.py            # 15 tests (HealthService, PingService)
│   └── test_config.py              # 17 tests (Settings, get_settings)
├── integration/
│   ├── test_exception_handlers.py  # 14 tests (HTTP, validation, generic handlers)
│   └── test_dto_mapping.py         # 13 tests (DTO validation, serialization)
└── api/
    ├── test_health_endpoint.py     # 12 tests (end-to-end /health)
    └── test_ping_endpoint.py       # 11 tests (end-to-end /ping)
```

### Key Testing Patterns Defined

1. **Fixture Strategy**
   - `test_settings()`: Override settings for isolated test environment
   - `test_app()`: Fresh FastAPI app per test with dependency overrides
   - `client()`: TestClient for synchronous API testing
   - `fixed_datetime()`: Deterministic time for timestamp testing
   - Domain model data fixtures for reusable test data

2. **Unit Testing Approach**
   - Domain models: Test validation, immutability, business invariants
   - Services: Mock dependencies, test business logic in isolation
   - Config: Test environment loading, caching, type validation

3. **Integration Testing Approach**
   - Exception handlers: Test with real FastAPI request/response cycle
   - DTOs: Test Pydantic validation and serialization
   - Full dependency injection chain

4. **API Testing Approach**
   - End-to-end endpoint tests with TestClient
   - Response structure, status codes, headers validation
   - CORS configuration verification
   - OpenAPI documentation validation

### Critical Testing Insights

**Coverage Targets by Layer:**
- Domain Layer: 100% (business logic critical)
- Application Layer: 100% (use cases)
- Infrastructure - DTOs: 95% (Pydantic validation)
- Infrastructure - Middleware: 90% (exception handlers)
- Infrastructure - Routes: 95% (API endpoints)
- Configuration: 90% (settings management)
- **Overall Target: 95%+**

**Test Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Don't test framework internals (FastAPI, Pydantic)
- Don't share state between tests
- Don't use sleep() for timing tests
- Don't test implementation details, test behavior
- Don't skip error scenario testing

**Best Practices Emphasized:**
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Descriptive test names (test_should_xxx_when_yyy)
- Parametrized tests for similar scenarios
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Fresh fixtures per test for isolation
- Fixed datetime for deterministic time testing

### Test Implementation Estimates

- Total test cases: 105 tests
- Estimated lines of test code: ~1,450 LOC
- Estimated implementation time: 12 hours
- Expected execution time: < 5 seconds (full suite)

### Testing Infrastructure

**conftest.py highlights:**
- Dependency override for test settings
- Function-scoped fixtures for test isolation
- Fixed datetime fixture for time-based tests
- Mock service fixtures for router testing
- Reusable domain model data fixtures

**pytest Configuration Recommendations:**
```ini
[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
addopts =
    -v
    --cov=app
    --cov-branch
    --cov-report=term-missing
    --cov-report=html
    --cov-fail-under=95
```

### Test Case Highlights

**Domain Model Tests (23 tests):**
- HealthStatus enum validation
- HealthCheck immutability and business rules (empty version/environment)
- PingResponse validation and constraints
- Parametrized tests for all enum values

**Service Tests (15 tests):**
- HealthService returns correct status, version, environment
- PingService returns "pong" message
- Timestamp generation with mocked datetime
- Settings dependency injection

**Exception Handler Tests (14 tests):**
- HTTP exceptions return consistent error format
- Validation errors include detailed field errors
- Generic exceptions hide internal details (security)
- All return proper status codes

**API Tests (23 tests):**
- /health returns 200 with correct structure
- /ping returns 200 with pong message
- Timestamps are recent and properly formatted
- Endpoints documented in OpenAPI schema
- CORS headers present
- Method restrictions (GET only)

### Future Test Enhancements

When adding new features:
- **Database layer**: Repository tests, transaction rollback fixtures
- **Authentication**: JWT tests, authorization tests, session management
- **External services**: Mock APIs, timeout/retry tests
- **Performance**: Load tests, response time benchmarks

### Documentation Created

Comprehensive test plan saved to:
`.claude/doc/fastapi_backend_boilerplate/backend-tests.md`

**Includes:**
- Complete test case specifications with expected outcomes
- Code examples for all test scenarios
- Fixture design patterns and best practices
- Assertion patterns and parametrized test examples
- Testing anti-patterns to avoid
- Coverage goals and metrics
- Test execution strategies
- CI/CD integration recommendations
- Future enhancement patterns

### Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Start with conftest.py**: Set up shared fixtures first
2. **Implement unit tests first**: Domain → Services → Config
3. **Then integration tests**: Exception handlers → DTOs
4. **Finally API tests**: Health → Ping endpoints
5. **Run coverage after each category**: Ensure targets are met
6. **Use provided examples as templates**: Adapt as needed

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests pass
- Coverage >= 95%
- No skipped or xfailed tests
- Test suite completes in < 5 seconds
- All tests isolated (can run in any order)

### Test Plan Status

- Planning: COMPLETE
- Implementation: NOT STARTED (awaiting parent agent)
- Execution target: 105 tests, 95%+ coverage, < 5s runtime

**The test plan is ready for implementation and provides a solid foundation for ensuring code quality and reliability of the FastAPI backend boilerplate.**
