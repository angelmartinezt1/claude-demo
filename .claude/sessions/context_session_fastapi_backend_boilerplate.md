# FastAPI Backend Boilerplate - Context Session

## Feature Description
Create a simple FastAPI backend boilerplate with health and ping routes.

## Initial Analysis

### Objective
Set up a minimal FastAPI application in the `backend/` directory with:
- Basic project structure
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Ping endpoint (`/ping`)
- Proper dependency management (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
- Basic configuration setup

### Technical Considerations

1. **Project Structure**
   - Main application file
   - Configuration module
   - Router organization
   - Dependency injection setup

2. **Endpoints Required**
   - `/health`: Returns application health status
   - `/ping`: Simple ping-pong response for connectivity testing

3. **Best Practices to Follow**
   - Hexagonal architecture patterns (as per project conventions)
   - Proper dependency management
   - Environment configuration
   - Type safety with Pydantic models

4. **Dependencies Needed**
   - FastAPI
   - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
   - Pydantic (data validation)
   - Python-dotenv (environment variables)

### Questions for Backend Developer Agent
1. Should we follow hexagonal architecture for this simple boilerplate?
2. What project structure would be most appropriate?
3. Should we include additional configuration for CORS, middleware, etc.?
4. What response models should we use for health and ping endpoints?

#### Key Recommendations

**Architecture Decision:**
- Use SIMPLIFIED hexagonal architecture (not full hexagonal for simple endpoints)
- Establish core patterns (domain, application, infrastructure layers)
- Avoid over-engineering while maintaining expansion path
- Balance between learning opportunities and pragmatism

**Project Structure:**
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── domain/              # Domain models (framework-agnostic)
│   ├── application/         # Application services (use cases)
│   └── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure adapters
│       ├── web/            # FastAPI routers, DTOs
│       └── middleware/     # Exception handlers
└── tests/                  # Comprehensive test suite
```

**Technology Stack:**
- FastAPI 0.115.0
- Uvicorn with standard extras (uvloop, httptools)
- Pydantic 2.9.2 + pydantic-settings 2.6.1
- pytest with async support

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
1. Domain models as frozen dataclasses with `__post_init__` validation
2. Application services with constructor dependency injection
3. Pydantic DTOs separate from domain models
4. Thin routers delegating to services via `Depends()`
5. Consistent error handling with custom exception handlers
6. Configuration via pydantic-settings with `@lru_cache()`

**Implementation Notes:**
- Python 3.11+ required (modern type hints)
- All handlers should be async
- CORS preconfigured for common dev ports
- OpenAPI documentation auto-generated
- 100% test coverage achievable for this simple boilerplate

**Documentation Created:**
Comprehensive implementation plan saved to:
`.claude/doc/fastapi_backend_boilerplate/backend.md`

Includes:
- Complete file-by-file implementation guide
- All code examples with detailed comments
- Critical implementation notes
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Testing strategy
- Production considerations
- Expansion patterns for future features

## Plan
Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
