# FastAPI Backend Boilerplate - Context Session

## Feature Description
Create a simple FastAPI backend boilerplate with health and ping routes.

## Initial Analysis

### Objective
Set up a minimal FastAPI application in the `backend/` directory with:
- Basic project structure
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Ping endpoint (`/ping`)
- Proper dependency management (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
- Basic configuration setup

### Technical Considerations

1. **Project Structure**
   - Main application file
   - Configuration module
   - Router organization
   - Dependency injection setup

2. **Endpoints Required**
   - `/health`: Returns application health status
   - `/ping`: Simple ping-pong response for connectivity testing

3. **Best Practices to Follow**
   - Hexagonal architecture patterns (as per project conventions)
   - Proper dependency management
   - Environment configuration
   - Type safety with Pydantic models

4. **Dependencies Needed**
   - FastAPI
   - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
   - Pydantic (data validation)
   - Python-dotenv (environment variables)

### Questions for Backend Developer Agent
1. Should we follow hexagonal architecture for this simple boilerplate?
2. What project structure would be most appropriate?
3. Should we include additional configuration for CORS, middleware, etc.?
4. What response models should we use for health and ping endpoints?
