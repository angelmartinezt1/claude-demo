    "Mobile considerations: CSS animations offer better battery life and performance on mobile devices due to GPU acceleration.",
    "Off-Main-Thread Animation (OMTA): Only works with transform and opacity properties. Enabled by default in Firefox Nightly/Developer Edition.",
    "Frame budget: Target 60fps means 16.7ms per frame. Complex animations may need optimization or fallback strategies.",
    "CSS vs JavaScript trade-off: CSS animations run on compositor thread (better performance), but JavaScript offers more control for complex interactions.",
    "Vendor prefixes: Older browsers may require -webkit- prefixes for CSS animations, though modern browsers no longer need them.",
    "requestAnimationFrame: Stops when tab is inactive (good for performance), but may affect multi-tab scenarios.",
    "SEO and accessibility: Ensure animations don't block critical rendering paths. Lazy-load offscreen animations.",
    "Safari-specific: Use webkit translation transforms for hardware acceleration. Recent Safari 19 introduces scroll-driven animations."
